ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Our company has experienced strong growth during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Total revenue increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by successful product launches and effective market expansion strategies. We achieved a positive outcome in our international markets, with growth particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific region.

Our innovation pipeline remains robust, with beneficial investments in research and development contributing to multiple new product categories. Creative solutions developed during the year have positioned us for a profitable future. We accomplished key milestones in our cloud services division, with customer adoption exceeding expectations.

Financial Highlights

Revenue for the year was $394.3 billion, an increase of $42.5 billion compared to the prior year. This growth was achieved despite challenging macroeconomic conditions and uncertain global trade environments. Our operating margin improved to 30.1%, reflecting effective cost management and strong pricing discipline.

We must acknowledge that certain risk factors may impact our future performance. The volatility in semiconductor supply chains perhaps represents the most significant uncertainty we face. Litigation related to patent disputes might delay some product launches, though we believe the impact will be manageable.

Despite these challenges, our cash position remains excellent, with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. This strong balance sheet provides us with the opportunity to pursue strategic acquisitions and enhance shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.
