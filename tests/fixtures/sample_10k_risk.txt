ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investing in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before investing in our common stock.

Global and Regional Economic Conditions

Our business may decline as a result of a deterioration in global economic conditions. Economic uncertainty, including high inflation, rising interest rates, and volatile foreign currency exchange rates, may cause consumers and businesses to reduce spending. A default by one or more major financial institutions might trigger a broader economic decline with negative consequences for our business.

We are unable to predict the duration or extent of current economic uncertainty. Our inability to accurately forecast demand could result in excess inventory or loss of sales opportunities.

Competition and Market Risks

The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. Our failure to compete effectively could result in a decline in our market share and profitability. We face risks from both established competitors and new market entrants who may offer products at lower price points.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

We are subject to various lawsuits and litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The penalty for non-compliance with evolving regulatory requirements could be substantial. New data privacy laws may impose additional constraints on our operations, and weak enforcement in some jurisdictions creates uncertainty about compliance standards.

Supply Chain Risks

We worry about the vulnerability of our global supply chain to disruption. The abandonment of certain supplier relationships, abnormal weather events, or the abuse of trade restrictions could impair our ability to deliver products to customers. A delay in obtaining critical components might cause us to default on delivery commitments.
